## Setup
- Install the required tools.
  1. We'll use a git to get libigl, which is a library our assignment relies on for handling geometry. After that, we'll use cmake along with a C++ compiler to put everything together.
  2. To set up C++ development on Windows, start by installing Visual Studio Community Edition. Then, within Visual Studio, go to Tools and select Get Tools and Features. From there, choose "Desktop Development with C++" and "Linux Development with C++". This will equip you with a C++ compiler and cmake, respectively.

- Download and build the code.
  1. In Visual Studio on Windows, go to File, then Open, and select CMake. Choose the CMakeLists.txt file. This will trigger CMake to create a Visual Studio project. Afterward, you can build and run the code by directing Visual Studio to execute the target within the project folder.
